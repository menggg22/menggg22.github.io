I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA, working with Prof. Xiaobo Sharon Hu. 


Previously, I received the B.E. degree in microelectronic science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2019.

My current research interests are machine learning, software-hardware co-design, in-memory computing  and computing with emerging technologies.
