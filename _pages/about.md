I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA, working with Prof. Xiaobo Sharon Hu. I am also the recipient of a university fellowship. 

I am currently working on accelerating the emerging memory-intensive applications with the advanced development from the underlying hardware. My current research interests are machine learning, software-hardware co-design, in-memory computing and computing with emerging technologies. I have published several hardware/software codesign works as the first author in top EDA conferences: Design automation & test in europe (DATE), Design automation conference (DAC), Asia, and south pacific DAC (ASPDAC). 

Previously, I graduated with highest honor on the B.E. degree in microelectronic science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2019.
